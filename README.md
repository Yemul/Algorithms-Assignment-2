# Algorithms-Assignment-2
Write a generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue. The goal of this assignment is to implement elementary data structures using arrays and linked lists, and to introduce you to generics and iterators.

In my implementations, I used resizable arrays as the data structure for both Deque and RandomizedQueue class.
Alternatively, Deque can be implemented with nodes that have references to both the next node and the previous node.
